                <h2>Challenge:</h2>
                <p>The central challenge in working with a global leader like Adobe lies in the transferability of US-centric customer journeys to the specific DACH market. Despite world-class global UX standards, friction often occurs during the rollout of international assets because local user expectations, cultural nuances, and specific usability requirements in the German-speaking market vary significantly. The objective was to bridge the gap between central design specifications and local performance. This involved identifying potential conversion hurdles on product pages and within app stores, providing validated data to determine whether global concepts could be adopted as-is or if market-specific adaptations were mandatory.</p>

                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <p>To bridge this gap, a systematic user research process was established to critically evaluate the original US assets. Based on in-depth UX audits and heuristic evaluations, I developed user-flow hypotheses that were subsequently verified through targeted research methodologies. This included the design and analysis of comprehensive surveys and a detailed evaluation of Play Store and App Store presences. By creating new concepts for Product Detail Pages (PDPs), I ensured that the user experience was not only functionally sound but also resonated emotionally with the local target audience. The insights gained from these research phases served as a direct foundation for strategic decision-making and the optimization of digital touchpoints.</p>
