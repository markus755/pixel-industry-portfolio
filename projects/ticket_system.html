                <h2>Challenge:</h2>
                <p>The initial situation involved a highly specialized business case within the hardware and software leasing sector for which no adequate standard solution existed on the market. Existing ticketing systems proved to be too bloated, cost-intensive, and inflexible to accommodate Vertical’s specific multi-tenancy structure.

The core challenge was to map a two-tier support workflow: Vertical’s customers needed the ability to resolve technical issues for their employees internally first. Only in the event of critical escalations or hardware defects was a ticket to flow automatically to Vertical’s first-level support. This required the design of an exceptionally complex roles and permissions system that, despite its technical depth, had to remain intuitive for various user groups to minimize training efforts on the customer side.</p>

                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <p>As Senior UX Consultant, I led the entire design process from analysis to validation. The focus was on a Lean UX strategy to eliminate the complexity of market leaders and create a tailor-made solution for the Vertical ecosystem:

User Research & Benchmarking: Conducted competitive analysis and in-depth interviews with the Vertical support team to identify pain points and efficiency potential in escalation management.

Rapid Prototyping: Developed interactive low- and high-fidelity prototypes using Sketch and InVision to make hierarchical workflows and multi-tenant management tangible for stakeholders and customers at an early stage.

Technical Synergy: Collaborated closely with Vertical’s development team to ensure the complex authorization model was technically viable and seamlessly integrated into the existing device management platform.

Design System: Architected a scalable design system that ensured a consistent UI across all tenant levels and optimized the future maintainability of the platform.</p>
