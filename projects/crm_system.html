                <h2>Challenge:</h2>
                <p>A globally leading building materials producer faced a critical challenge: Despite its global presence, sales teams across diverse markets operated with outdated, inefficient, and decentralized processes. Each region—from France and Italy to the USA—used its own distinct SAP system. This fragmented landscape caused significant friction in internal communication and made it nearly impossible to ensure consistent and transparent workflows for contract negotiations, orders, and deliveries. There was an urgent need to re-establish and harmonize these processes within a central CRM system. The overarching goal was to improve efficiency, enhance data consistency, and build a future-proof, scalable solution that accommodated diverse regional requirements.</p>

                <h2>My Role & Solution:</h2>
                <p>My role was to lay the strategic foundation for the complete redesign of a central CRM system using MS Dynamics. My approach was to decode decentralized processes, understand complex regional SAP integrations, and develop a unified, user-centered solution. I conducted intensive 1-on-1 interviews with sales representatives worldwide and was deeply involved in workshops where market representatives detailed their specific customer journeys and pain points. The objective was to capture functional and technical requirements for the CRM flows firsthand.</p>
                
                <p>Based on these insights and in close collaboration with stakeholders, I conceptualized the new end-to-end journeys for the CRM system. I created interactive Figma prototypes and murals that visually and functionally represented the workflows for contract negotiation, order processing, and delivery logistics. These prototypes were then verified and iteratively optimized through remote usability tests with future users.</p>
