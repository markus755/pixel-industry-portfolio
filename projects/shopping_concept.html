                <h2>Challenge:</h2>
                <p>During my tenure at Vertical, I faced the complex challenge of harmonizing the discrepant needs of IT governance, cost control, and individual employee productivity within a hybrid enterprise environment. Many companies struggled with non-transparent procurement processes for hardware and software, leading to massive delays for end users. When an employee urgently needs a specific software license, such as Salesforce or Adobe Photoshop, lengthy manual approval processes hinder a seamless workflow. The strategic task was to conceptualize a system that radically simplifies the entire provisioning chain—from mobile hardware to cloud-based licensing. The goal was to minimize the hurdles of shadow IT while creating a solution scalable enough to map diverse corporate structures without losing sight of technical feasibility or economic efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <p>To realize the vision of an on-demand enterprise shop, I developed a comprehensive UX strategy deeply rooted in the analysis of existing business logic . Through targeted user research and remote interviews, I validated the pain points of current workflows and transformed these insights into a consistent end-to-end process . A significant part of my work involved strategically organizing the complex dependencies between user requests, supervisor approvals, and automated software distribution to make them visually tangible . In parallel, I was responsible for the architecture and implementation of a platform-wide design system in Sketch . This system was based on Material Design principles to ensure intuitive usability while enabling efficient, scalable development across the product landscape .</p>
