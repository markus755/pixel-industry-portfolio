                <h2>Challenge:</h2>
                <p>Serving as Lead UX Consultant since February 2024 for a market-leading corporation in the medical and healthcare sector requires steering a multitude of parallel digital initiatives within a high-velocity environment. The primary strategic challenge involved establishing a new, cohesive design system mid-process, while simultaneously architecting highly specialized applications, including an AI-driven wound care chatbot, a digital sample finder, and an eDetailing app. Furthermore, a navigation concept was developed to streamline the complexity of diverse business units across various digital environments. The core difficulty lies in critical synchronization: new landing pages and application structures must reach production rapidly, yet the structural integrity of the emerging design system cannot be compromised. Without robust UX governance and a continuous evaluation of existing components, the risk of fragmented user journeys and significant design debt during the scaling of digital touchpoints would be substantial.</p>

                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <p>To address these demands, an agile, Figma-centric design workflow was implemented, functioning as a high-performance bridge between business objectives, design strategy, and technical execution. A cornerstone of this solution was the development of a token-based design system directly within Figma, which was iteratively scaled and applied to emerging project scopes. By delivering comprehensive wireframes and low-to-high-fidelity prototypes for both mobile and desktop, functional clarity was maximized for all stakeholders despite aggressive timelines. The conceptual framework was reinforced by stakeholder interviews across various markets, ensuring that localized requirements were integrated directly into the eDetailing app's architecture. Continuous, cross-functional collaboration between design and engineering ensured that every newly architected component was technically viable and optimized for implementation. This systematic approach allowed complex concepts like the Sample Finder to become tangible quickly, facilitating informed design decisions through direct executive dialogue and ensuring a seamless, high-quality user experience across the entire digital ecosystem.</p>
