                <h2>Challenge:</h2>
                <p>In large corporate structures, fragmented procurement processes and support requests often lead to massive efficiency losses. The central challenge at Matrix42 was to consolidate two highly complex platforms into a single, intuitive tool to eliminate the proliferation of isolated solutions. The objective was to develop a comprehensive self-service platform that enables employees to independently order hardware and software via an internal shop. This required the seamless integration of complex approval workflows for managers, including automated notifications and decision-making stages. In parallel, the system needed to serve as a central hub for IT support, allowing users to create tickets or reduce support overhead through automated solution suggestions. The primary hurdle was ensuring flexibility, as the system had to be individually configurable for each client company without compromising usability or technical integrity.</p>

                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <p>The solution was based on a consistently data-driven design strategy, where I acted as the central liaison between management, clients, and development teams. To establish a solid foundation for all design decisions, I first conducted comprehensive 1:1 user interviews to understand the specific requirements and existing workflows of the users in detail. Based on these insights, I developed interactive prototypes in Axure, which were consolidated in close coordination with developers to ensure the technical feasibility of the complex shop logic from the outset. These prototypes served as a crucial basis for the subsequent validation phase with beta customers, whose feedback was directly incorporated into the conception of the initial MVPs. In the final design phase, I implemented a UI design based on Material Design principles, specifically adapted for the high functional requirements of an enterprise environment.</p>
