                <h2>Challenge:</h2>
                <p>Generation of a filter to display electric car charging points on a map of Germany. Many energy suppliers are currently represented in Germany with their own car charging points or offer their tariffs to charging stations from other suppliers. There are also many differences in plug variants, AC/DC current, charging capacities, payment options, etc. One of the main problems is getting an overview of the different charging points since many providers only locate their own charging points on a map and not those of other providers. Although the energy supplier operates its own charging stations in this project, it would like to use various filter mechanisms about AC/DC current, plug type, region, etc., to help users quickly and easily find the best charging point for them.</p>

            <div class="project-column animate-slide-right">
                <h2>Solution:</h2>
                <p>When the current appearance was revised, the filter mentioned above was further worked on. Accordingly, different variants of prototypes were iteratively developed and implemented by the development team. Since most of the target group opens the existing site on a mobile device and the users are not at home when a charging station is needed, the focus was clearly on the mobile version. Care was taken to ensure that individual users can find the required settings quickly and intuitively and that the page does not have long loading times.</p>
