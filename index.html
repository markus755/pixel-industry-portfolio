            <h1> UX Strategy & Digital Product Consulting by Markus Mueller</h1>
            <p>I help companies translate complex challenges into thoughtful digital strategies. With over ten years of experience in digital design, UX, and consulting, my focus today is on anchoring user-centricity as an integral part of digital transformation. I see myself as a bridge builder between business goals, technical feasibility, and the people who use the products.

For me, it is about more than just interfaces: it is about establishing modern processes and providing targeted consulting to make digital products not just functional, but strategically successful.</p>
